# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Introduction

Louise was interested in funding a play and was considering launching a Kickstarter campaign to do so.  We analyzed data from thousands of other campaigns on the crowdfunding service to see what she should or should not do in order to maximize her liklihood of success.

## Launch Date

If possible, launching her campaign in May would be her best bet.  Not only did May have the highest number of successful campaigns, successful campaigns nearly doubled the number of those that failed.

Luckily for Louise, theater campaigns appear to have a moderate success rate, with about 1.5 successful campaigns for each failure.  While not nearly as successful as music campaigns, for instance, they are far more likely to succeed than more risky food or game Kickstarters.
